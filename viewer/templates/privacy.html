  <h1>Privacy and Data Retention Policy</h1>

  <p>The Society for Creative Anachronism Inc. and its affiliates (the SCA) collect personal details of members which are used exclusively for verifying access to the SCA'S activities and publications. Integral to the SCA's activities is its system of honours and awards.</p>

  <p>When honours and awards are given to participants in SCA activities, a record of the honour or award is kept in a database called an Order of Precedence. The Order of Precedence supports the SCA's regular activities including but not limited to modes of interaction among members, conferring further honours and awards, and maintaining historical records and statistics. The Kingdom of Drachenwald, a unit of the SCA, gives, through its officers accredited in a geographical area defined by the SCA Inc., honours and awards to participants in SCA activities. These are Drachenwald Awards. Participants in SCA activities in that geographical area also hold honours and awards from other kingdoms, which for this purpose are non-Drachenwald awards. Both kinds of awards are recorded in the Order of Precedence.</p>

  <p>All participants in SCA activities are subject to being given awards or honours. Participants in SCA activities are always informed when given these awards and honours. According to Kingdom of Drachenwald policy, these awards and honours should be recorded in the Order of Precedence within 30 days.The Order of Precedence records participants' real names, as well as other names under which the participants are known in the SCA. The Order of Precedence also records the names of awards and the dates when they were conferred, and the images and blazons of coats of arms which have been registered by members with the SCA College of Arms. The information is stored on a computer database which can be searched by real name, but which only provides society names, award names and award dates in response to database queries. Anyone can query the database. Database managers have access to participants' real names. The database is available on the Internet, and can normally be accessed from the Drachenwald Web site at <a href="http://op.drachenwald.sca.org">http://op.drachenwald.sca.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Participants who wish to report their Order of Precedence entry to another SCA kingdom may apply to Post Horn Herald, an officer of the Society for Creative Anachronism Inc, at <a href="mailto:posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org">posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Updating the database twice yearly is the responsibility of the Schwarzdrachen Principal Herald, an officer of the Society for Creative Anachronism Inc. Requests to update or change the database can be sent to <a href="mailto:posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org">posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org</a>. Queries about one's own entry may also be sent to <a href="mailto:posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org">posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org</a>. If requested by a participant who has ceased to participate in the Society, Schwarzdrachen Principal Herald will ensure that that person's real name, Society names, coat of arms (graphic image and blazon) and details of non-Drachenwald awards will be deleted from the database. The name of the participant will be replaced with a text string which will identify only the country of residence of the former participant, and add additional text to make the record effectively unique. Such requests should be made to <a href="mailto:posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org">posthorn@drachenwald.sca.org</a>.</p>
